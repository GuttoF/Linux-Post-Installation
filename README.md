A Shell Script that makes a basic setup on ubuntu-based distro for my daily use. It comes with snap, docker  and pyenv config, you can choose witch one do you want to install

# How can I install it?

Just go to your terminal and:

~~~shell
# run install.sh
bash install.sh

# if you want to install another one
bash something.sh
~~~
